Assignment for the final project.

<!--more-->

Here it is! The final project is fairly open-ended, so go to town.

## Two Choices

1. Continue your Timepiece project in another iteration
2. Propose a new project

Either way, please send me your proposal ASAP!

## Requirements

 * Should incorporate at least one of:
	- images
	- video
	- sound
	- data source
 * Must include user interactivity
 * Must run in the browser
 * Must be uploaded to a publicly accessible server when complete (weâ€™ll cover this)
