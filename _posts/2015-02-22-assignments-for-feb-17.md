## Review

Building on our [assignment from last week](/2015/02/04/readings-and-assignments-for-feb-10.html), we discussed the results and traded programs one more time. In class we did a basic introduction to HTML & CSS, and had some work time to try out HTML.

## Assignment

### Markup two of your text samples as HTML and style them with CSS

You may select two of your text samples â€” you have the option to select either original texts, the result of running your text through your "program", or result of running your text through a classmate's "program."

 1. Enter both texts into `index.html`, each on in-between one of the `<section></section>` blocks.
 2. Add HTML markup (tags) to each text. Each one should use a minimum of **3 HTML tags, 6 total** between both of them.
 3. Add CSS styles to both of your texts. Have fun with it!
    * Use a minimim of **8 CSS selectors**.
    * Include a minimum of **2 font definitions**.


### Example

You can find [example code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/two-texts/tree/gh-pages/example-html) on GitHub, and see the rendered HTML page [here](http://parsons-cc.github.io/two-texts/example-html/). You will also want to check the [resources](/resources.html) page for more help!
