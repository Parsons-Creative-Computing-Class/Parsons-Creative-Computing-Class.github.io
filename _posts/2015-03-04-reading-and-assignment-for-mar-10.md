For next week, finish up the "patternist" project and have it ready to present in class. Also, the next chapter from _Eloquent Javascript_ will give you some more information about functions and how they work.

## Readings

Please read Chapter 3 from [Marijn Haverbeke's _Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) for next week's class.

## Assignment

Please finish up last week's assignment, refining your pattern and adding at least one function to the code.


### Review

I've posted the example exercises from in class to the [class GitHub account](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist). Reviewing these may be helpful to complete the assignment. Remember to use your JavaScript console for the first two!

 1. [Exercise One (printing to the console)](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/exercise-one/index.html) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/exercise-one/index.html))
 2. [Exercise Two (loops & conditionals)](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/exercise-two/index.html) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/exercise-two/index.html))
 3. [Exercise Three (print to the page)](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/exercise-three/index.html) ([code](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/exercise-three/index.html))
 4. [Exercise Four (print to the page, using a function)](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/exercise-four/) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/exercise-four/index.html))

### Examples

I've also provided a few examples of a basic composition:

 * [Maze](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/example-maze/) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/example-maze/index.html))
 * [Crosshatch](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/example-crosshatch/) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/example-crosshatch/index.html))
 * [Emoticons](http://parsons-cc.github.io/patternist/example-advanced/) ([code](https://github.com/parsons-cc/patternist/blob/gh-pages/example-advanced/index.html))

### Resources

More helpful links (including some of the ones I provided last week) can be found on the [resources](/resources.html) page.

 * [The p5 dom library](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) â€” these are some of the functions that allow you to output to the html page
 * [JavaScript Functions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) - a function reference from w3schools
 * [CSS Classes](http://www.tizag.com/cssT/class.php) - more information on how CSS classes work
 * [Copy Paste Character](http://copypastecharacter.com) &#9988;


### Evaluation (Grading)

This assignment will be graded based on the following:

 * The assignment is submitted on time
 * The program runs in the browser
 * The program outputs a finite number of lines (covered in Exercise One)
 * The program output changes over time (covered in Exercise Two)
 * The program outputs to the HTML page (covered in Exercise Three)
 * The program includes at least one function (covered in Exercise Four)

Please submit your assignment via a [GitHub Pull Request](/github-guide.html), as usual.
