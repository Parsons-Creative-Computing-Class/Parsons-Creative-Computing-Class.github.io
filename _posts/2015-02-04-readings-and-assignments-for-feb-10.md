title: Reading & Assignment for Feb 10
---

Great to meet everyone in person finally! Here are your readings and assignments for next class.

<!--more-->

### Reading

For next week you'll need to read to finish Alexander Galloway's first chapter in _Protocol_. You can find links to the PDF on the [readings](/readings.html) page of the class site. You can also check the [example]() to get a sense of how it will look when you're done.

### Assignment

We will essentially be finishing the assignment we started in-class, writing a program to modify our texts. You will be saving your progress via [GitHub](http://github.com). The goals for this part of the assignment are:


### Go through two more iterations of your program, improving it each time.
  1. If you haven't already, enter your original instructions into GitHub in the file `program.txt` on GitHub. Make sure commit (save) your changes.
  2. Based on what you learned in class trying your program on someone else's text, modify your instructions to try and fix any "bugs" you found.
   * If your rules are too specific, try adding some more conditions to the rule: "If (something) then (something) , otherwise (something)".
   * You can also try generalizing your rules more, although this risks being less interesting.
  3. Commit your second pass of the instructions in GitHub. Explain in the commit message what you changed and why.

  4. Try your modified instructions on both of your texts to see how they work.
  5. Try steps 2-3 again, making more modifications based on what you found. Think about how you can make your instructions more widely applicable to other texts, and yet still produce an interesting result.
  6. Once you have your final instructions, enter the results beneath your original texts in `one.txt` and `two.txt`. Commit these changes in GitHub.

### Enter citations into the `README.md` file

If you open the `README.md` file, you'll see the following:

    ### Text 1

    <!-- replace this with your citation -->

    ### Text 2

    <!-- replace this with your citation -->

Replace each comment `<!-- replace this with your citation -->` with the citation for each of your texts (see the [example](https://github.com/parsons-cc/two-texts/blob/gh-pages/example-txt/README.md)).

### Submit everything via a Pull Request

![Pull Request](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2100102/parsons-cc/spring-2015/pull-request.png)

You should be submitting the following updated files when you're done:

 * `program.txt` with your final instructions
 * `README.md` with your cited sources
 * `data/one.txt` with your results below the original text
 * `data/two.txt` with your results below the original text
