title: Readings & Assignments for Feb 3 Class
---

Since we missed a week already we'll be playing a bit of catch-up. There are two readings due next week, and two small assignments.

<!--more-->

### Readings

For next week you'll need to read an excerpt from Karl Gerstner's _Designing Programmes_ and get at least halfway through Alexander Galloway's first chapter in _Protocol_. You can find links to the PDFs on the [readings](/readings.html) page of the class site.

### Assignments

 1. I would like you to select two text excerpts, between 500 to 1000 characters long, to class. I'll give you two prompts for each one:
	* A text that inspires you
	* A text that you find interesting but you don't totally understand
 2. I'd like everyone to signup for a free [GitHub](http://github.com) account before the next class, as we'll be using it for some of the assignments.

Please email me your GitHub username and your two texts **by Monday night**, as indicated in [the syllabus](http://github.com/parsons-cc/syllabus).
