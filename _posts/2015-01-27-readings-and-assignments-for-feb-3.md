title: Readings & Assignments for Feb 3
---

Since we missed a week already we'll be playing a bit of catch-up. There are two readings due next week, and two small assignments.

<!--more-->

### Readings

For next week you'll need to read an excerpt from Karl Gerstner's _Designing Programmes_ and get at least halfway through Alexander Galloway's first chapter in _Protocol_. You can find links to the PDFs on the [readings](/readings.html) page of the class site.

### Assignments

 1. Select two text excerpts, each written by somebody other than yourself. They can can be from anywhere, just as long as you can cite your sources. Each text excerpt should be between 500 to 1000 characters in length (you can use [this site](http://www.lettercount.com/) to check the length). You should select one text for each of the following two prompts:
	* Something that inspires you
	* Something that you find interesting but don't fully understand
 2. I'd like everyone to signup for a free [GitHub](http://github.com) account before the next class, as we'll be using it for some of the assignments.

Please email me your GitHub username and your two texts **by Monday night**, as indicated in [the syllabus](http://github.com/parsons-cc/syllabus).

Looking forward to meeting everyone in person next Tuesday!
