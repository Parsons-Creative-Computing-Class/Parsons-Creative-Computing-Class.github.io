## Readings

Please read Chapter 4 from [Marijn Haverbeke's _Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html) for next week's class.

## Assignments

 1. Propose a composition for the browser that incorporates change over time (doesnâ€™t have to be a clock!). Include at least two sketches.
 2. Propose a research project that explores a technique or technology of the web.
 3. Complete Assignment #2 ("patternist") if you haven't already.

See below for more details.


### "Timepiece" Project Proposal

Propose a composition for the browser that incorporates time in some way, including at least two sketches. You should focus on concept and design here, and we'll discuss the best approach and difficulty of your proposal. See below for some examples from class:

 * Alexander Chen's [_Piano Phase_](http://www.chenalexander.com/Piano-Phase) (original score by [Steve Reich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Phase))
 * Andrew LeClair's [_Scroll Clock_](http://andrewleclair.com/scrollclock/)
 * Eric Levin's [_Come Down to Us](http://ericrius1.github.io/ComeDownToUs/) ([more info](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/come-down-to-us))
 * Joe McKay, [_Sunset Solitare_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DchBgy8yCd0&feature=youtu.be) ([more info](http://www.joemckaystudio.com/sunset.php))
 * Christian Marclay, [The Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_%282010_film%29)


### Research Project

Propose a research project that explores a technique or technology of the web. This can be related to your "Timepiece" project, but doesn't have to be. Some possible topics:

 * [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions)
 * [CSS Selectors](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/)
 * [JavaScript `addEventListener` method](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp)
 * [the Document Object Model (DOM)](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)
 * [JavaScript `setTimeout`](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)
