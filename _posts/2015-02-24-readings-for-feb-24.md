title: Readings for Feb 24
---

There's no assignment for next Tuesday, but there are two readings. We'll start the next assignment in class, and I'll go over grades with each of you from the first assignment.

## Readings

We have two readings for next week:

 1. Chapters 1-4 of Petzold's [_Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software_](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2100102/parsons-cc/spring-2015/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf) will fill in a bit more historical background for us.
 2. [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) is a nice short little JavaScript primer, and should serve as a good supplement to the material we covered in last class.

There will be a (very) short quiz at the beginning of the next class based on the readings.
