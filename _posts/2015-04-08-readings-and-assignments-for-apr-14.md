Jumping into our "Timepiece" project and a bit of reading.

<!--more-->

## Readings

Please read Chapter 12 from [Marijn Haverbeke's _Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) for next week's class.

## Assignments

**Have a prototype of your "Timepiece" project ready for class.** We will review them in class.

See below for more details.

### "Timepiece" Prototype

Don't be two scared by the prospect of creating a prototype. Your goal for this phase of your project should be to:


 1. Identify the most challenging technical aspect(s) of your project and focus on that. For many of you, this will overlap somewhat with your research project which could be helpful.
 2. Break down your project into its simplest parts based on the technical challenges. (For instance, if you need to animate a figure across the screen and have it play sounds, then use the simplest shape possible for the figure and only one or two of the sounds you are aiming for).
 3. Try to get a sense of what your biggest challenges will be for completing the final version of your project. This may be a point to re-evaluate your plan based on what you learned.
