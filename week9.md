## Discussion

## HTML assignment

How'd it go? Discuss.

## Git demo (let's try that again!)

**Fire up those terminals!** First, go to your `~/Code` folder and open it (should have created last class):

```bash
$ cd ~/Code
$ open .
```

Make sure that `git` is installed:

```bash
$ git --version
```

Now go to [GitHub](http://github.com) and login. When you're logged in you should see your class site linked under "Your Repositories". It should look similar to the image below, but be titled **"[your username].github.io"**. Click through to go to the repo for your class site!

![Class site repo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2100102/parsons-cc/images/find-class-site.png)

Once you're there, in the righthand column you should see a little box that says "HTTPS clone URL". **Copy the link** from the text box to your clipboard:

![Git Clone URL](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2100102/parsons-cc/images/git-clone.png)

Now back to the terminal. Let's make sure we're in the right place:

```bash
$ cd ~/Code
$ pwd
```

You should see something like `/Users/[your user name]/Code`. Now we can check out the Git repository! Make sure to double-check this command before you hit enter:

```bash
$ git clone [paste the copied link here] class-site-git
```

You should see a bunch of stuff happen and when it's done, you've cloned your git repo! You can open your `Code` folder in the finder to check:

```bash
$ open .
```

# Assignment

## [Timepiece](https://github.com/parsons-cc/timepiece) Part 1

 1. Sketch out **3** different concepts of a composition for the browser that demonstrates the "change over time"
  * 1 of them should be something that you think is reasonably attainable based on what you already know
  * 2 of them should be "blue sky" ideas that you don't necessarily know how to do
  * Each concept should include images and text, but you can document them however you prefer (photos of hand-written notes, mockups in Photoshop, a [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/) site with annotated images, etc.).
  * Please indicate which concepts are the "blue sky" ones and which is the more attainable one.
 2. Pick one of the "blue sky" ideas and research how you might make it a reality. Document your research with your own notes about how you _might_ make it happen.

**Part 1 of this assignment can be submitted via your class Google doc.**
