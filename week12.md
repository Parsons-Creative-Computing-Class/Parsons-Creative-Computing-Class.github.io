## Example

 * Site: http://parsons-cc.github.io/music-video-seu-mane-luiz/
 * Code: https://github.com/parsons-cc/music-video-seu-mane-luiz

## Things to think about

 * Music videos
 * Sound as user interface
 * How can sound better communicate your idea?

## Options

1. Continue your "Timepiece" project
2. Start a new project

## Requirements

 * Similar to "Timepiece" project
 * We will have 3 check-ins: concept, prototype, completion.
 * Must include sound!

# Assignments for next class

1. Submit Timepiece if you haven't already
2. Have three concepts ready for final project
